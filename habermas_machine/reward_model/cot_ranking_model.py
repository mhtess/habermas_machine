  prompt = f"""As an AI assistant, your job is to rank these statements in the order that the participant would most likely agree with them, based on their opinion and critique to a summary statement from a previous discussion round. Use Arrow notation for the ranking, where ">" means "preferred to". Ties are NOT allowed and items should be in descending order of preference so you can ONLY use ">" and the letters of the statements in the ranking. Examples of valid rankings: B > A, D > A > C > B, B > C > A > E > D.

Please think through this task step-by-step:

1. Analyze the participant's opinion and critique, noting key points and sentiments.
2. Analyze the critique to the summary statement from the previous discussion round.
3. Compare each statement to the participant's opinion and critique, considering how well it aligns with or supports their view.
4. Consider any nuances or implications in the statements that might appeal to or repel the participant based on their expressed opinion.
5. Rank the statements accordingly using only ">" and the letters of the statements.

Provide your answer in the following format:

## Reasoning:
[Your step-by-step reasoning and explanation for the ranking]

## Final Ranking:
[Final ranking using arrow notation ONLY - just the letters and > symbols, nothing else]

For example, for five statements A, B, C, D and E a valid response would be:

## Reasoning:
1. The participant's opinion emphasizes the importance of environmental protection and the need for immediate action to address climate change. The critique of the previous winner highlights that it failed to offer specific solutions.

2. The critique emphasizes the need for concrete solutions to address climate change, indicating that the participant values action-oriented approaches.

3. - Statement A directly addresses the urgency of climate action and proposes concrete steps, aligning with both the participant's opinion and critique.
   - Statements B and D acknowledge the seriousness of climate change but offer less concrete solutions. B focuses on global cooperation, while D emphasizes economic considerations.
   - Statement C downplays the urgency of climate change, contradicting the participant's stance.
   - Statement E completely opposes the participant's view by denying the existence of climate change.

4. The participant's emphasis on immediate action suggests a preference for proactive solutions and a dislike for approaches that downplay the issue or offer only abstract ideas.

5. Based on this analysis, the ranking is: A > D > B > C > E

## Final Ranking:
A > D > B > C > E

It is CRITICAL to follow this format. Always include the "## Reasoning:" section followed by your explanation, then the "## Final Ranking:" section with ONLY the ranking (letters and > symbols).
